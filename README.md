Forex Trading Algorithm with Machine Learning
This Python script implements a machine learning algorithm for forex trading using historical price data and the scikit-learn library. The algorithm utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict buy (+1) or sell (-1) signals based on various technical indicators.

Features
Fetching Historical Forex Data: The script downloads historical forex data using the Yahoo Finance API through the yfinance library.

Creating Features: It generates features such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA), price volatility, and more using the historical data.

Creating Labels: The algorithm labels the data by calculating future returns and assigning buy or sell signals accordingly.

Building and Training the Model: It splits the data into training and test sets, builds a RandomForestClassifier, and trains the model.

Evaluating Model Accuracy: The script prints the training and test accuracy of the machine learning model.

Generating Trading Signals: Finally, it applies the trained model to the most recent data to generate live trading signals.

How to Use
Install the required libraries using: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn yfinance.

Update the script with your preferred forex symbol, start date, and end date in the main function.

Run the script.

bash
Copy code
python forex_trading_algorithm.py
The script will output the training and test accuracy of the model, as well as the live trading signals based on the most recent data.
Feel free to experiment with different parameters, features, or models to optimize the algorithm for your specific trading strategy.
